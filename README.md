Hello World: React and TypeScript
=======

The purpose of this guide is to share my steps to setup a web project with React and TypeScript. I have ran through many demos, tutorials, and videos on React. Yet, finding up to date info on writing React apps with TypeScript was hard to do at the time I wrote this.

My main focus will be on establishing a development environment and dealing with some of the quirks with coding React apps with TypeScript. This guide won't be a deep dive in React or TypeScript. There are many resource available to facilitate a deep dive into each of them. This guide will only look at integration of the two.
