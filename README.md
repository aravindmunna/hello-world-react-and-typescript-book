Hello React and TypeScript
=======

The purpose of this guide is to share my steps to setup a web project with React and TypeScript. I have ran through many demos, tutorials, and videos on React and TypeScript separately. Yet, finding up to date info on writing React apps with TypeScript was hard to do at the time I wrote this.

My main focus will be on establishing a development environment and dealing with some of the quirks with coding React apps with TypeScript. When I started I thought that this guide wouldn't explore many of the concepts in React or TypeScript, but as I learned more I decided to write about them. It won't provide a deep inspection of all things React or TypeScript, but I will go deeper than just a simple Hello World. 

There are many resource available to facilitate a deep dive into React and TypeScript. This guide will hone in on possible integrations of the two in terms of a development environment, coding paradigms and style. The scope is small and this should not be taken as a best practices guide. This is just my personal practice and there are many ways to do this kind of development. I just hope that this can equip you to explore more practices for your particular set of problems that can be solved with React and TypeScript.
