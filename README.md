Hello World: React and TypeScript
=======

The purpose of this guide is to share my steps to setup a web project with React and TypeScript. I have ran through many demos, tutorials, and videos on React and TypeScript. Yet, finding up to date info on writing React apps with TypeScript was hard to do at the time I wrote this.

My main focus will be on establishing a development environment and dealing with some of the quirks with coding React apps with TypeScript. This guide won't be a deep dive in React or TypeScript. There are many resource available to facilitate a deep dive into each of them. This guide will only look at possible integrations in terms of a development environment, coding paradigms and style. The scope is small and this should not be taken as a best practices guide. This is just my personal practice and there are many ways to do this kind of development. I just hope that this can equip you to explore more practices for your particular set of problems that can be solved with React and TypeScript.
