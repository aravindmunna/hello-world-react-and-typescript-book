#Hello World

To start this party off right we will jump right into a review of some code samples. We will be using the proverbial Hello World app. I think this is a little more approachable than some of the many ToDo demos and other more real world applications being used to tout React. I am not saying the demos are bad, but React is a significant paradigm shift for many developers and I think a slow build up is good for old dogs like myself trying to learn new tricks. 

Exploring Hello World is great to get you grounded before exploring more "real world" type applications. We will even take the basic Hello World a little farther than simply displaying text to get exposure to the core concepts in React.
